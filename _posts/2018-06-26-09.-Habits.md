Seemed fitting to kick off a renewed effort in sustained writing by taking time to contemplate habits themselves - what habits I’ve built, where I’ve succeeded and failed in creating them, and what value they’ve brought to my life. 

I’ve more recently become a firm believer in the premise that in times of adversity and exhaustion you fall to the base level of your training and discipline - none of this rising to the occasion nonsense. That is to say that while there may be times where you “rise to the occasion” per the popular media definition, these tend to be flukes and provide one with a false sense of confidence, rather than serve as candid indicators of actual performance and value. 

Habits are the mechanism through which the floor is raised for life quality and performance. They convert desired activity from conscious consideration to unconscious instinct, freeing bandwidth for further progression. They indicate the preference of long term over short term investment - the recognition that no single gym session builds your dream physique, no single stroke wins you the swim race. 

The first habit I ever consciously decided to pick up was flossing. I’d always seen it as a superfluous activity but upon a firm reprimanding by my dentist, I figured the benefits of picking up a flossing habit would be two fold - I’d pick up much needed momentum in building habits and sorting the general chaos of my adolescent life and with a couple of minutes a day I could dramatically improve my dental health. 

That first one was the perfect starter - low effort, disproportionately high payout, easy stickiness. Others have been less successful. There was a stretch where I was meditating every morning, but that didn’t hold up against mornings where I felt restless. Neither did morning journaling. And here we are with writing, trying to reignite the flame. 

The thing with habits is in order for them to stick, they need to be deconstructed to their component parts - the trigger, the environment, the result. Those can take many different forms. If necessary, an accountability system, when carefully constructed, can work wonders. More on that another time. 

More than anything though, I’ve noticed that when habits are eased into, starting with almost comically low bars, those are the ones I’ve stuck with the most. It’s going to the gym for 30 minutes 3 time a week - not popping in for a 2 hour session sporadically once a month. On that note - I’m done for the week. To sustained excellence.
