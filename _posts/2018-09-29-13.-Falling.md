Slow motion. 

One moment cruising, everything coming effortlessly. 

Confidence high, spirits higher. 



A lull in the action, seemingly innocuous. 

Blip of worry appears in the mind, easily brushed aside. 

Then, trouble. 



Balance escapes you. 

Life starts teetering out of control. 

You're falling. 



Stress levels spike.

Panic sets in, you take manic evasive action. 

Control escapes you. 



Public humiliation is at stake. 

The fall at this point is inevitable.

You wait for the crash. 



Cold hard concrete.

Picking yourself up, dusting yourself off.

Trying to save face.



Welcome to the life of a boy. 

Learning how to ride his new bike, clip in pedals.

Lump by lump.
