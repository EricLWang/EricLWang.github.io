Slow motion.   
One moment cruising, everything coming effortlessly.   
Confidence high, spirits higher.
<br><br>
A lull in the action, seemingly innocuous.   
Blip of worry appears in the mind, brushed aside.   
Then, trouble. 
<br><br>
Balance escapes you.   
Life starts teetering out of control.   
You're falling. 
<br><br>
Stress levels spike.  
Panic sets in, you take manic evasive action.   
Control escapes you. 
<br><br>
Public humiliation is at stake.   
The fall at this point is inevitable.  
You wait for the crash. 
<br><br>
Cold hard concrete.  
Picking yourself up, dusting yourself off.  
Trying to save face.
<br><br>
Welcome to the life of a man.   
Learning how to ride his new bike, clip in pedals.  
Lump by lump.
